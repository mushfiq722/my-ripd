    <h1 class="noti">CAT FOOD</h1>
    <h3 id="ola">Dry food </h3>
        <p id="frist" >Dry food (8â€“10% moisture) is generally made by extrusion cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase palatability, and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall paper bags, sometimes with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.</p>
    <h3 id="ola">A renal diet </h3>
        <p id="sceond">A renal diet is formulated for cats that are living with chronic kidney disease, or CKD. This is a highly prevalent condition in the feline population and is most common in the aging and older domesticated feline.[14] It has been shown that the 
            lifespan of cats experiencing CKD can be extended by as much as 2 years when receiving therapeutic 
            diets rather than regular maintenance diets.[15] 
            These diets are low in protein, low in phosphorus, have a high energy density, a higher fat content and include omega-3 fatty acids.
            
            Low protein diets can be formulated as a wet or dry food, with the main difference being the moisture content.[16][15] Unfortunately, low protein diets are not as palatable to cats as diets high in protein.[15]
            
        
            In low protein diets, unless the protein source is a high quality protein such as an animal-based protein, cats (and especially kittens) have been shown to develop retinal degeneration due to a deficiency in taurine, an essential amino acid for cats that is derived from animal protein.[18]</p>

            <p id="third">
            Low protein diets have been linked to health defects such as lack of growth, decreased food intake, muscle atrophy, hypoalbuminemia, skin alterations, and more. Cats on lower protein diets are more likely to lose weight, and to lose lean body mass.</p>

        <p>A screw and a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below) are similar types of fastener typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a male thread (external thread). Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in the matching part.
    
            Screws are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together and prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.</p>

        <p>Dog food is food specifically formulated and intended for consumption by dogs and other related canines. Dogs are considered to be omnivores with a carnivorous bias. They have the sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for the consumption of meat than of vegetable substances, yet also have 10 genes that are responsible for starch and glucose digestion, as well as the ability to produce amylase, an enzyme that functions to break down carbohydrates into simple sugars - something that carnivores lack.[1] Dogs evolved the ability living alongside humans in agricultural societies, as they managed on scrap leftovers from humans.[2][3]
    
            Dogs have managed to adapt over thousands of years to survive on the meat and non-meat scraps and leftovers of human existence and thrive on a variety of foods, with studies suggesting dogs' ability to digest carbohydrates easily may be a key difference between dogs and wolves.[1]
            
            In the United States alone, the dog food market is expected to reach $23.3 billion by 2022</p>
